# 🐍 Python Assignments Collection – Complete Guide

Welcome to the collection of Python assignments and mini-projects designed to strengthen your Python programming fundamentals and logical problem-solving skills. This repository is structured into **three assignments**, each progressing from basic syntax to creative mini-projects.

---

## 📘 Assignment 1: Python Fundamentals

This assignment introduces the core building blocks of Python. It’s divided into six structured modules:

---

### 🔹 Step 00 – `00_intro_python.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Python syntax  
- Variables & data types (int, float, str, bool)  
- `print()` function  

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Demonstrates basic Python operations like variable assignments and output printing to help beginners understand the structure of a Python script.

---

### 🔹 Step 01 – `01_expressions.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)  
- Operator precedence  
- Type casting (`int()`, `float()`)

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Evaluates different mathematical expressions and introduces how Python handles calculations and data conversion.

---

### 🔹 Step 02 – `02_lists.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- List creation and indexing  
- List methods: `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.reverse()`  
- Slicing and iteration

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Shows how to store multiple items in a list, access/modify them, and perform basic list manipulations.

---

### 🔹 Step 03 – `03_if_statements.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- Logical conditions: greater than, less than, equal

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero, and compares two numbers using decision-making logic.

---

### 🔹 Step 04 – `04_dictionaries.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Dictionaries (`dict`) and key-value pairs  
- Accessing, updating, adding, and deleting items  
- Looping through dictionaries with `.items()`

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Represents a person’s profile and demonstrates how to retrieve, update, and loop through data using a dictionary.

---

### 🔹 Step 05 – `05_loops_control_flow.py`  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- `for` loop and `while` loop  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`  
- Ranges and iteration

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Includes number printing, even number checks, and examples of breaking and skipping loops under specific conditions.

---

## 📗 Assignment 2: Basic Python Projects (`01_basics/` Folder)

This assignment contains beginner-level mini-projects. These projects apply your understanding of inputs, logic, and control flow.

---

### 🔹 `00_joke_bot.py` – JokeBot 😂  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- User input  
- Conditional logic (`if-else`)  
- `random.choice()` for selecting jokes from a list  

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- A simple chatbot that asks if the user wants a joke and displays a random one if the user agrees.

---

### 🔹 `01_double_it.py` – Number Doubler ✌️  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Functions  
- Exception handling (`try-except`)  
- `input()` with type conversion

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Takes a number as input, doubles it, and displays the result. Handles invalid input gracefully.

---

### 🔹 `02_liftoff.py` – Countdown Timer 🚀  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- `for` loop with reverse range  
- `time.sleep()` for delays  
- Output formatting  

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Creates a countdown from 10 to 1 with 1-second delays, ending in a “Liftoff!” message.

---

### 🔹 `03_guess_my_number.py` – Number Guessing Game 🎯  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)  
- User input, loops, and conditional feedback

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Lets the user guess a number until they get it right, with hints like “Too high” or “Too low”.

---

### 🔹 `04_random_numbers.py` – Random Number Generator 🔢  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Random module  
- Input validation  
- Loops, sorting, optional uniqueness

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Takes user preferences for quantity, range, and uniqueness of random numbers, and displays them—optionally sorted.

---

## 📕 Assignment 3: Intermediate Python Projects (`02_intermediate/` Folder)

These projects take your skills up a level and focus on creative problem-solving.

---

### 🔹 `mad_libs.py` – Mad Libs Story Generator 📖  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- String formatting  
- Dynamic user input  
- Humorous creativity  

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- Asks users for different types of words and inserts them into a predefined story to create funny results.

---

### 🔹 `guess_number_computer.py` – Computer Guesses Your Number 💻  
**📚 Concepts Covered:**  
- Binary search logic  
- While loop  
- Interactive user feedback  

**🛠️ What It Does:**  
- The computer tries to guess a number you're thinking of by narrowing down the range based on your hints.

---

### 🔹 `guess_number_user.py` – User Guesses the Number 🔢
